# Introduction

Rust Floating UI is a Rust port of [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/).

[Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com) is a library that helps you create “floating” elements such as tooltips, popovers, dropdowns, and more.

## Frameworks

Rust Floating UI is available for the following frameworks:

-   [DOM (`web-sys`)](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/web-sys/index.html)
-   [Leptos](https://leptos.dev/)

The following frameworks are under consideration:

-   [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/)
-   [Yew](https://yew.rs/)

<!--
## Smart Anchor Positioning

Anchor a floating element next to another element while making sure it stays in view by **avoiding collisions**. This lets you position tooltips, popovers, or dropdowns optimally.

TODO: fix infinite loop?
```toml,trunk
package = "floating-ui-book"
features = ["placement"]
```
